                    My music project is my first ever written program in Python. I used it in 2022 Youth Hacking For Freedom Competition 
                    and won a first place in category "Women".

                    This project is a multimedia application developed using Python, specifically tailored for music education and exploration.
                    It leverages the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to interactively engage with various musical
                    concepts such as notes, chords, and scales. The application utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing, enabling the display
                    of musical notations and instructions in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. Additionally, the Playsound library is integrated to provide
                    auditory feedback by playing corresponding musical sounds when users interact with the displayed notes, chords, or scales.

            <div class = "description-box">
                <p>
                    The GUI is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, featuring buttons for different musical modes ("Notes", "Chords", "Scales") that,
                    when selected, display relevant musical information and allow for the playback of associated sounds. The application also includes a help button,
                    offering guidance and information on navigating the features. The layout is organized with a main canvas area where images and buttons related to 
                    the selected musical mode are dynamically updated, enhancing the interactive learning experience.

                    This application stands as an excellent tool for beginners in music theory, providing a hands-on approach to learning musical notes, understanding 
                    the structure of chords, and exploring the formation of scales. The use of visual and auditory elements makes it an engaging platform for users 
                    of all ages who are interested in music education.
